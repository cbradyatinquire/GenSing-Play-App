Below are the steps needed to switch to production mode:

1. Assign a "name" to the Play! Framework installation on your machine (assign a Framework ID). Run:

$ ~/play-1.2.2/play id

Play! Framework will prompt you to ype in an id. Just leave blank to unset a previously set id. For example, type in "cnectNIE".
Official documentation on preparing for production mode for Play 1.2.2 can be found here:
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.2.7/guide11
Official documentation for Play! 1.2.2 can be found here:
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.2.7/home


2. Get Play! Framework to talk to MySQL. Edit the file GenSing-Play-App/conf/application.conf and add in lines for your framework id. There's an example set-up provided, which has the framework id "cnect1". Just search for lines containing "cnect1" and add a new line with exact same contents as cnect1, except replace cnect1 with your framework id (e.g. replace cnect1 with cnectNIE):

%cnect1.application.mode=prod
%cnectNIE.application.mode=prod
...
%cnect1.db=mysql:root:cnect@CNECTDB
%cnectNIE.db=mysql:root:secret@CNECTDB   ( means: connect to mysql with account "root" and password "secret", connect to database named "CNECTDB" )
...
#%cnect1.jpa.ddl=create
#%cnectNIE.jpa.ddl=create


3. Create a database named "CNECTDB" in mysql. Login to MySQL as root and type in:

mysql> create database CNECTDB;

Which will create the database. It needs to be created first before running the GenSing-Play_App in production mode


4. Apply database evolutions. The Database schema has changed a few times during the course of development. So before starting GenSing-Play-App for the first time, in production mode, we need to apply the evolutions first.Simply execute these commands in sequence:
more documentation on database evolutions for play 1.2.2 can be foun here:
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.2.7/evolutions

$ ~/play-1.2.2/play evolutions

$ ~/play-1.2.2/play evolutions:resolve

$ ~/play-1.2.2/play evolutions:markApplied

and then finally, to run the GenSing-Play-App, execute:

$ ~/play-1.2.2/play run (subsequent launches simply need to execute this line)

The server will be started and listening on port 9000. Here's an example output:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/GenSing-Play-App$ ~/play-1.2.2/play run

Any incoming contribution will now be saved to the CNECTDB database in mysql. Congratulations! you have successfully run it in production mode! :)
